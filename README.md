In this post, I comment on the data visualization art of Norwood Viviano in his Cities: Departure and Deviation exhibit. 

This repo contains consolidated population data (largely from the US Census: see TDS article for a full list of data sources)
as well as code for line graphs that visualize the same trends captured by Viviano.
